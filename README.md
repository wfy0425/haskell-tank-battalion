## Game
Tank Battalion is a classic shooter arcade video game in which the player control a tank defned the player's base as well as destory all AI controlling enemy tanks. The player would lose if either player's tank being destoryed by AI or player's base being destoryed by AI. A round is cleared when the player destory all AI controlling enemy tanks.

This project is aiming to build a Haskell version of Tank Battalion. The terminal user interface would be implemented using the brick library.
