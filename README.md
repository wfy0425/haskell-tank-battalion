## Game
Tank Battalion is a classic shooter arcade video game in which the player controls a tank that defends the player's base as well as destroys all AI-controlling enemy tanks. The player will lose if either player's tank is destroyed by AI or the player's base is destroyed by AI. A round is cleared when the player destroys all AI-controlling enemy tanks.

This project aims to build a Haskell version of the Tank Battalion. The terminal user interface would be implemented using the brick library.
